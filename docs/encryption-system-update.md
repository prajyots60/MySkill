# Video Encryption System Changes

## Overview of the Problem
The encryption system had an issue where the IV (Initialization Vector) stored in the database sometimes differed from the IV actually prepended to the encrypted file. This caused decryption failures when trying to play encrypted videos.

## Root Cause
During the encryption process, the encryption worker correctly generated a random IV and prepended it to the encrypted data. However, in the API route handling completion, sometimes a different IV would be generated and stored in the database. This mismatch between the IV in the database and the IV prepended to the file caused decryption failures.

## Implemented Fixes

### 1. Fixed decryptFile Function in videojs-wasabi-player.tsx
The `decryptFile` function now always uses the IV from the file header (first 12 bytes) for decryption and ignores the IV from database metadata. This ensures that decryption always uses the correct IV that was used during encryption.

### 2. Fixed wasabi-complete API Route
Updated the `wasabi-complete` API route to never generate a new random IV when storing encryption metadata. Now it always uses the IV provided by the encryption worker, which matches the IV prepended to the file.

### 3. Fixed headerBytes Reference
Fixed a reference to an undefined variable (`headerBytes`) in the decryption function that was causing issues when checking for MP4 signatures.

### 4. Added Encryption Debugging Tools
Created an Encryption Inspector tool and debug page to help diagnose encryption and decryption issues. This tool can:
- Extract the IV from encrypted video files
- Compare the IV in the file with the IV stored in the database
- Display detailed information about the encryption format
- Provide guidance for troubleshooting encryption issues

### 5. Added API Route for Encryption Metadata
Created a new `/api/lectures/[id]/wasabi-metadata` API route to retrieve encryption metadata for a specific lecture. This helps with diagnostics and debugging.

## Testing and Verification
After implementing these changes, the encrypted video playback should work correctly because:
1. The decryption always uses the IV from the file header
2. We've fixed the potential causes of IV mismatch in the database
3. Better debugging tools are available to diagnose any remaining issues

## Future Improvements
1. Consider adding encryption metadata validation when uploading videos
2. Add a database migration to fix any existing records with mismatched IVs
3. Implement additional encryption diagnostics in the UI for administrators

## Encryption Standards
- All videos are encrypted using AES-GCM with a 256-bit key
- The IV is always 12 bytes (96 bits) as required by the AES-GCM standard
- The IV is always prepended to the encrypted file
- Encryption keys are stored as 64-character hex strings (256 bits)
